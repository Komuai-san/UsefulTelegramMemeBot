mainhelp = """Hi there! This might be an introduction, or there might be an error (whatever). To know about the commands for specific tasks, kindly type one of these (without the quotation marks.)

1.) 'help' for serious functions (wiki, dictionary with audio, quotes, local coronavirus information, sneaker shoe informer). Like, things that Google can already do ðŸ™„

2.) 'red' for Reddit functions. (e.g. random subreddits, hot/new topics)

3.) 'fun' for the fun stuff. (cats, dogs, dad jokes)

4.) 'main' to summon this text guide again.

5.) 'proj' to see the source code of this bot.

I will add 9gag scraper in the future if Reddit is not enough. Lol.

"""

projectlink = 'https://github.com/Komuai-san/UsefulTelegramMemeBot'

usefulhelp = """ Here are the useful commands.

1.) 'wiki' plus Anything you want to search = Returns a list of wiki links related to your query. (takes some time but does the job.)

2.) 'weekc' plus Anything you want to search = Returns a long-ass(depends) summary on the subject. Most of the time it works as long as the term is disambiguated. This is experimental and would not return anything if summary is really long, or if the search term is ambiguous. I will tell you if that's the case.

3.) 'mshoes' = Randomly shows you a pair of shoes for men with its title, price in dollars, release date, and if possible, an image of it (which is always the case). 

4.) 'wshoes' = Same thing, but it shows a pair of shoes for women.

5.) 'bio' plus First name and last name of author = Returns a short information about the author you've entered.

6.) 'otor' plus Author's name or full name = Returns a list of an author's written works and their ISBN (or books related to them). It's primed to a maximum of 40 books.

7.) 'bwok' plus ISBN of the book = Returns an excerpt of the book you're interested in. Search term must be in ISBN. The 'otor' command above can return ISBNs.

7.) 'dict' plus the word = Shows you the definition of the word with example, synonym, and audio file.

8.) 'corona' = To know about the corona cases in the Philippines.

9.) 'weder' plus city/country = To know the current weather.

10.) 'unsplash' plus anything = Returns an image closest to the word you searched. This is pretty much hit or miss, but the image is really high-quality. I suggest searching using broader terms.

1.) 'quote' = Shows a random quote from famous figures.

"""

fun = """ Commands to summon the funny:

1.) 'cats' or 'cat' = Returns a random image of a cat in jpg or gif. I really love cats you know.

2.) 'dogs' or 'dog' or 'doge' = Returns a random image of a dog in jpg or gif. I believe it'll cheer anyone up.

3.) 'dadjoke' = self-explanatory.

    "Ad Astra - Scipio to Hannibal - A classic for a history buff like me. It's a historical fiction about the real feud between Rome and Carthage.
